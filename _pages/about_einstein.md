I am a tenure-track assistant professor at [Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago (TTIC)] (https://www.ttic.edu/). My research focuses on machine learning and optimization, especially on deep learning theory.

I received my PhD from the [Computer Science Department] (https://www.ttic.edu/) at Princeton University in 2022, where I was advised by [Prof. Sanjeev Arora](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~arora/). I was a postdoctoral fellow in [Computer Science Department at Stanford University](https://www.cs.stanford.edu/), working with [Tengyu Ma](https://ai.stanford.edu/~tengyuma/). I did my undergraduate study at [Yao Class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/) (2013-2017), Tsinghua University.


Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
